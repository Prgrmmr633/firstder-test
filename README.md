# DERMAFY Demo

> Demo on Dermafy: Innovative AI Skin Disease Diagnosis Application

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the installation of the DERMAFY demo, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **Python**: The programming language used to build the application.
- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints.
- **SQLAlchemy**: The Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.
- **PostgreSQL**: The open-source relational database used for storing the application data.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Install Python**

   Download and install the latest version of Python from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install PostgreSQL**

   Follow the installation guide for PostgreSQL on your operating system. This involves downloading PostgreSQL, installing it, and possibly configuring it to start automatically.

3. **Setup the Application Environment**

   - Navigate to the file repository directory:

     ```bash
     cd firstderm-test
     ```

   - Install the dependencies including FastAPI and SQLAlchemy (these should be listed in your `requirements.txt` file):

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

   - For Windows users, go to your Python installation folder (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Python312`).

   - Duplicate `python.exe` and rename it to `python3.exe`. This step ensures compatibility with scripts that explicitly call `python3`.

## Usage

To run the DERMAFY demo application, use the following command:

```bash
python3 main.py
```
